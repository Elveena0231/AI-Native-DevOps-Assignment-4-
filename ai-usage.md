# AI Usage Notes

This repository contains auto-generated scaffolding and some components produced
with AI assistance. Use the components as a starting point and review code for
security and correctness before deployment.

Suggested next steps:
- Review `kong/` Dockerfile and build process for custom plugins.
- Replace placeholder secrets and images with secure, production-ready values.
- Add CI to validate Helm templates and Terraform plans on PRs.
