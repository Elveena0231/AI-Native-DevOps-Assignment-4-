AI-Native DevOps Assignment 4  
 
Secure API Platform using Kong on Kubernetes 
Context  
Your organization is building a self-managed internal API platform. 
Key requirements: 
APIs must be protected using JWT-based authentication 
Certain APIs must bypass authentication 
Traffic protection must include: 
IP-based rate limiting 
DDoS protection (open-source, self-managed) 
Platform must run on Kubernetes 
API Gateway must be Kong (OSS / self-managed) 
You are expected to build the system from scratch, using AI tools as primary assistants for design, coding, debugging, and refactoring. 
 
Problem Statement 
Design and implement a Kubernetes-based API platform that exposes a secure microservice through Kong Gateway. 
The platform must: 
Use JWT authentication 
Store users in a local SQLite database 
Enforce IP-based rate limiting and IP whitelisting 
Bypass authentication for selected APIs 
Be deployable using Helm charts 
Include custom Kong Lua logic 
Be reproducible locally or on any Kubernetes cluster 
 
Microservice API Requirements 
Implement a sample user service with the following APIs: 
Authentication APIs 
Endpoint 
Method 
Description 
/login 
POST 
Authenticate user and return JWT 
/verify 
GET 
Verify JWT token 
User APIs 
Endpoint 
Method 
Authentication 
/users 
GET 
Required (JWT) 
Public APIs (Authentication Bypass) 
Endpoint 
Method 
Authentication 
/health 
GET 
Not required 
/verify 
GET 
Not required 
 
Database Requirements 
Use SQLite (local, file-based database) 
Store: 
User records 
Secure password hashes 
Database must be auto-initialized at service startup 
No external or managed databases are allowed 
 
Kubernetes & Deployment Requirements 
Mandatory 
Containerize the microservice 
Kubernetes resources must include: 
Deployment 
Service 
No imperative kubectl commands 
All resources must be declarative and version-controlled 
 
Kong API Gateway Requirements 
Authentication 
JWT-based authentication using Kong JWT plugin 
Selected APIs must bypass authentication: 
/health 
/verify 
JWT secrets must be externalized (not hardcoded) 
 
Rate Limiting 
IP-based rate limiting via Kong plugin 
Example policy: 10 requests per minute per IP 
 
IP Whitelisting 
Allow traffic only from configurable CIDR ranges 
Block all other inbound traffic at the gateway level 
 
Custom Kong Lua Logic 
Implement at least one custom Lua script, such as: 
Custom request/response header injection 
Additional token validation logic 
Structured request logging 
Requirements: 
Lua code must be version-controlled 
Lua logic must be deployed via Kong configuration 
 
DDoS Protection (Mandatory) 
Implement one open-source, self-managed DDoS protection mechanism suitable for Kubernetes. 
Examples (candidate selects one): 
NGINX Ingress + ModSecurity 
Kong + ModSecurity 
CrowdSec 
Envoy-based rate and connection controls 
The candidate must: 
Explain the reason for choosing the solution 
Describe how it integrates with Kong and Kubernetes 
Demonstrate basic protection behavior 
 
Infrastructure as Code 
Mandatory 
Helm charts for: 
Microservice deployment 
Kong configuration 
Clean and parameterized values.yaml usage 
Terraform for: 
Kubernetes cluster provisioning, or 
Namespaces / networking / base infrastructure

Deliverables 
1. README.md (Mandatory) 
Must include: 
High-level architecture overview 
API request flow (Client → Kong → Microservice) 
JWT authentication flow 
Authentication bypass strategy 
Testing steps for: 
Rate limiting 
IP whitelisting 
DDoS protection 
 
2. AI Usage Documentation (ai-usage.md) - “Please make sure not use AI to generate this file, it should be as it is.”  
Must clearly describe: 
AI tools used 
Prompts interaction and history
